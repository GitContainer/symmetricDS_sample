  <p>This User Guide will introduce both basic and advanced concepts in the
  configuration of SymmetricDS. By the end of this chapter, you will have a
  better understanding of SymmetricDS' capabilities, and many of its basic
  concepts.</p>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="requirements"></a>1.1.&nbsp;System Requirements</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>SymmetricDS is written in Java and requires a Java SE Runtime
    Environment (JRE) or Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 6.0 or
    above.</p>

    <p>Any database with trigger technology and a JDBC driver has the
    potential to run SymmetricDS. The database is abstracted through a
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Database Dialect</em></span> in order to support specific
    features of each database. The following Database Dialects have been
    included with this release:</p>

      <p>SymmetricDS is a Java-based application that hosts a
      synchronization engine which acts as an agent for data synchronization
      between a single database instance and other synchronization engines in
      a network.</p>

      <p>The SymmetricDS engine is referred to as a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>node</em></span>. SymmetricDS is designed to be able to scale
      out to many thousands of nodes. The database connection is configured by
      providing a database connection string, database user, and database
      password in a properties file. SymmetricDS can synchronize any table
      that is accessible by the database connection, given that the database
      user has been assigned the appropriate database permissions.</p>

      <div class="figure"><a name="figure-overview-1"></a><div class="figure-contents">
        

        <div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/overview-1.gif" alt="Simple Configuration"></div>
      </div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.1.&nbsp;Simple Configuration</b></p></div><br class="figure-break">

      <p>A SymmetricDS node is assigned an external id and a node group id.
      The external id is a meaningful, user-assigned identifier that is used
      by SymmetricDS to understand which data is destined for a given node.
      The node group id is used to identify groupings or tiers of nodes. It
      defines where the node fits into the overall node network. For example,
      one node group might be named &#8220;corporate&#8221; and represent an enterprise or
      corporate database. Another node group might be named &#8220;local_office&#8221; and
      represent databases located in different offices across a country. The
      external id for a &#8220;local_office&#8221; could be an office number or some other
      identifying alphanumeric string. A node is uniquely identified in a
      network by a node id that is automatically generated from the external
      id. If local office number 1 had two office databases and two
      SymmetricDS nodes, they would probably have an external id of &#8220;1&#8221; and
      node ids of &#8220;1-1&#8221; and &#8220;1-2.&#8221;</p>

      <p>SymmetricDS can be deployed in a number of ways. The most common
      option is to deploy it as a stand alone process running as a service on
      your chosen server platform. When deployed in this manner SymmetricDS
      can act as either a client, a multi-tenant server or both depending on
      where the SymmetricDS database fits into the overall network of
      databases. Although it can run on the same server as its database, it is
      not required to do so. SymmetricDS can also be deployed as a web
      application in an application server such as Apache Tomcat, JBoss
      Application Server, IBM WebSphere, or others.</p>

      <p>SymmetricDS was designed to be a simple, approachable,
      non-threatening tool for technology personnel. It can be thought of and
      dealt with as a web application, only instead of a browser as the
      client, other SymmetricDS engines are the clients. It has all the
      characteristics of a web application and can be tuned using the same
      principles that would be used to tune user facing web
      applications.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e86"></a>1.2.2.&nbsp;Change Data Capture</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>Changes are captured at a SymmetricDS enabled database by database
      triggers that are installed automatically by SymmetricDS based on
      configuration settings that you specify. The database triggers record
      data changes in the <a href="data-model.html#table_data" title="A.3.&nbsp;DATA">DATA</a>
      table. The triggers are designed to be as noninvasive and as
      lightweight as possible. After SymmetricDS triggers are installed,
      changes are captured for any Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements
      performed by external applications. Note that no additional libraries or
      changes are needed by the applications that use the database and
      SymmetricDS does not have to be online for data to be captured.</p>

      <p>Database tables that need to be replicated are configured in a
      series of SymmetricDS configuration tables. The configuration for the
      entire network of nodes is typically managed at a central node in the
      network, known as the registration server node. The registration server
      node is almost always the same node as the root node in a tree topology.
      When configuring &#8220;leaf&#8221; nodes, one of the start-up parameters is the URL
      of the registration server node. If the &#8220;leaf&#8221; node has not yet
      registered, it contacts the registration server and requests to join the
      network. Upon acceptance, the node downloads its configuration. After a
      node is registered, SymmetricDS can also provide an initial load of data
      before synchronization starts.</p>

      <p>SymmetricDS will install or update its database triggers at
      start-up time and on a regular basis when a scheduled sync triggers
      job runs (by default, each night at midnight). The sync triggers job
      detects changes to your database structure or trigger configuration when
      deciding whether a trigger needs to be rebuilt. Optionally, the sync
      triggers job can be turned off and the database triggers DDL script can
      be generated and run by a DBA.</p>

      <p>After changed data is inserted by the database trigger into the
      <a href="data-model.html#table_data" title="A.3.&nbsp;DATA">DATA</a> table, it is batched and
      assigned to a node by the router job. Routing data refers to choosing
      the nodes in the SymmetricDS network to which the data should be sent.
      By default, data is routed to other nodes based on the node group.
      Optionally, characteristics of the data or of the target nodes can also
      be used for routing. A batch of data is a group of data changes that are
      transported and loaded together at the target node in a single database
      transaction. Batches are recorded in the <a href="data-model.html#table_outgoing_batch" title="A.29.&nbsp;OUTGOING_BATCH">OUTGOING_BATCH</a> . Batches are node
      specific. <a href="data-model.html#table_data" title="A.3.&nbsp;DATA">DATA</a> and <a href="data-model.html#table_outgoing_batch" title="A.29.&nbsp;OUTGOING_BATCH">OUTGOING_BATCH</a> are linked by <a href="data-model.html#table_data_event" title="A.4.&nbsp;DATA_EVENT">DATA_EVENT</a> . The delivery status of
      a batch is maintained in <a href="data-model.html#table_outgoing_batch" title="A.29.&nbsp;OUTGOING_BATCH">OUTGOING_BATCH</a> . After the data has been delivered to a remote node
      the batch status is changed to &#8216;OK.&#8217;</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e99"></a>1.2.3.&nbsp;Change Data Delivery</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>Data is delivered to remote nodes over HTTP or HTTPS. It can be
      delivered in one of two ways depending on the type of transport link
      that is configured between node groups. A node group can be configured
      to push changes to other nodes in a group or pull changes from other
      nodes in a group. Pushing is initiated from the push job at the source
      node. If there are batches that are waiting to be transported, the
      pushing node will reserve a connection to each target node using an HTTP
      HEAD request. If the reservation request is accepted, then the source
      node will fully extract the data for the batch. Data is extracted to a
      memory buffer in CSV format until a configurable threshold is reached.
      If the threshold is reached, the data is flushed to a file and the
      extraction of data continues to that file. After the batch has been
      extracted, it is transported using an HTTP PUT to the target node. The
      next batch is then extracted and sent. This is repeated until the
      maximum number of batches have been sent for each channel or there are
      no more batches available to send. After all the batches have been sent
      for one push, the target returns a list of the batch statuses.</p>

      <p>Pull requests are initiated by the pull job from at the target
      node. A pull request uses an HTTP GET. The same extraction process that
      happens for a "push" also happens during a "pull."</p>

      <p>After data has been extracted and transported, the data is loaded
      at the target node. Similar to the extract process, while data is being
      received the data loader will cache the CSV in a memory buffer until a
      threshold is reached. If the threshold is reached the data is flushed to
      a file and the receiving of data continues. After all of the data in a
      batch is available locally, a database connection is retrieved from the
      connection pool and the events that had occurred at the source database
      are played back against the target database.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d4e104"></a>1.2.4.&nbsp;Data Channels</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>Data is always delivered to a remote node in the order it was
      recorded for a specific channel. A channel is a user defined grouping of
      tables that are dependent on each other. Data that is captured for
      tables belonging to a channel is always synchronized together. Each
      trigger must be assigned a channel id as part of the trigger definition
      process. The channel id is recorded on SYM_DATA and SYM_OUTGOING_BATCH.
      If a batch fails to load, then no more data is sent for that channel
      until the failure has been addressed. Data on other channels will
      continue to be synchronized, however.</p>

      <p>If a remote node is offline, the data remains recorded at the
      source database until the node comes back online. Optionally, a timeout
      can be set where a node is removed from the network. Change data is
      purged from the data capture tables by SymmetricDS after it has been
      sent and a configurable purge retention period has been reached. Unsent
      change data for a disabled node is also purged.</p>

      <p>The default behavior of SymmetricDS in the case of data integrity
      errors is to attempt to repair the data. If an insert statement is run
      and there is already a row that exists, SymmetricDS will fall back and
      try to update the existing row. Likewise, if an update that was
      successful on a source node is run and no rows are found to update on
      the destination, then SymmetricDS will fall back to an insert on the
      destination. If a delete is run and no rows were deleted, the condition
      is simply logged. This behavior can be modified by tweaking the settings
      for conflict detection and resolution.</p>

      <p>SymmetricDS was designed to use standard web technologies so it
      can be scaled to many clients across different types of databases. It
      can synchronize data to and from as many client nodes as the deployed
      database and web infrastructure will support. When a two-tier database
      and web infrastructure is maxed out, a SymmetricDS network can be
      designed to use N-tiers to allow for even greater scalability. At this
      point we have covered what SymmetricDS is and how it does its job of
      replicating data to many databases using standard, well understood
      technologies.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d4e110"></a>1.3.&nbsp;Features</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>At a high level, SymmetricDS comes with a number of features that
    you are likely to need or want when doing data synchronization. A majority
    of these features were created as a direct result of real-world use of
    SymmetricDS in production settings.</p>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bi-sync"></a>1.3.1.&nbsp;Two-Way Table Synchronization</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>In practice, much of the data in a typical synchronization
      requires synchronization in just one direction. For example, a retail
      store sends its sales transactions to a central office, and the central
      office sends its stock items and pricing to the store. Other data may
      synchronize in both directions. For example, the retail store sends the
      central office an inventory document, and the central office updates the
      document status, which is then sent back to the store. SymmetricDS
      supports bi-directional or two-way table synchronization and avoids
      getting into update loops by only recording data changes outside of
      synchronization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="data-channels"></a>1.3.2.&nbsp;Data Channels</h3></div></div></div>


      



      <p>SymmetricDS supports the concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>channels</em></span>
      of data. Data synchronization is defined at the table (or table subset)
      level, and each managed table can be assigned to a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>channel</em></span> that helps control the flow of data. A
      channel is a category of data that can be enabled, prioritized and
      synchronized independently of other channels. For example, in a retail
      environment, users may be waiting for inventory documents to update
      while a promotional sale event updates a large number of items. If
      processed in order, the item updates would delay the inventory updates
      even though the data is unrelated. By assigning changes to the item
      tables to an <span class="emphasis"><em>item</em></span> channel and inventory tables'
      changes to an <span class="emphasis"><em>inventory</em></span> channel, the changes are
      processed independently so inventory can get through despite the large
      amount of item data.</p>

       Channels are discussed in more detail in

      <a href="config.html#configuration-channels" title="3.3.&nbsp;Channels">Section&nbsp;3.3, &#8220;Channels&#8221;</a>

       .
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="notification"></a>1.3.3.&nbsp;Change Notification</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>After a change to the database is recorded, the SymmetricDS nodes
      interested in the change are notified. Change notification is configured
      to perform either a <span class="emphasis"><em>push</em></span> (trickle-back) or a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>pull</em></span> (trickle-poll) of data. When several nodes
      target their changes to a central node, it is efficient to push the
      changes instead of waiting for the central node to pull from each source
      node. If the network configuration protects a node with a firewall, a
      pull configuration could allow the node to receive data changes that
      might otherwise be blocked using push. The frequency of the change
      notification is configurable and defaults to once per minute.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transports"></a>1.3.4.&nbsp;HTTP(S) Transport</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>By default, SymmetricDS uses web-based HTTP or HTTPS in a style
      called Representation State Transfer (REST). It is lightweight and easy
      to manage. A series of filters are also provided to enforce
      authentication and to restrict the number of simultaneous
      synchronization streams. The <code class="literal">ITransportManager</code>
      interface allows other transports to be implemented.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="plugins"></a>1.3.5.&nbsp;Data Filtering and Rerouting</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>Using SymmetricDS, data can be filtered as it is recorded,
      extracted, and loaded. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
            <p>Data routing is accomplished by assigning a router type to a
            <a href="data-model.html#table_router" title="A.33.&nbsp;ROUTER">ROUTER</a> configuration.
            Routers are responsible for identifying what target nodes captured
            changes should be delivered to. Custom routers are possible by
            providing a class implementing <code class="literal">IDataRouter</code>
            .</p>
          </li><li>
            <p>In addition to synchronization, SymmetricDS is also capable
            of performing fairly complex transformations (see <a href="config.html#configuration-transforms" title="3.8.&nbsp;Transforms">Section&nbsp;3.8</a> ) of data as
            the synchronization data is loaded into a target database. The
            transformations can be used to merge source data, make multiple
            copies of source data across multiple target tables, set defaults
            in the target tables, etc. The types of transformation can also be
            extended to create even more custom transformations.</p>
          </li><li>
            <p>As data changes are loaded in the target database, data can
            be filtered, either by a simple bean shell load filter (see
            <a href="config.html#configuration-load-filters" title="3.9.&nbsp;Load Filters">Section&nbsp;3.9</a>
            data-load-filter) or by a class implementing <a href="developer.html#extensions-data-loader-filter" title="6.1.2.&nbsp;IDatabaseWriterFilter">IDatabaseWriterFilter</a>. You
            can change the data in a column, route it somewhere else, trigger
            initial loads, or many other possibilities. One possible use might
            be to route credit card data to a secure database and blank it out
            as it loads into a centralized sales database. The filter can also
            prevent data from reaching the database altogether, effectively
            replacing the default data loading process.</p>
          </li></ul></div>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="transactions"></a>1.3.6.&nbsp;Transaction Awareness</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>Many databases provide a unique transaction identifier associated
      with the rows that are committed together as a transaction. SymmetricDS
      stores the transaction identifier, along with the data that changed, so
      it can play back the transaction exactly as it occurred originally. This
      means the target database maintains the same transactional integrity as
      its source. Support for transaction identification for supported
      databases is documented in the appendix of this guide.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="jmx"></a>1.3.7.&nbsp;Remote Management</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>Administration functions are exposed through Java Management
      Extensions (JMX) and can be accessed from the Java JConsole or through
      an application server. Functions include opening registration, reloading
      data, purging old data, and viewing batches. A number of configuration
      and runtime properties are available to be viewed as well.</p>

      <p>SymmetricDS also provides functionality to send SQL events through
      the same synchronization mechanism that is used to send data. The data
      payload can be any SQL statement. The event is processed and
      acknowledged just like any other event type.</p>

      <p>Quite a few users of SymmetricDS have found that they have a need to not only synchronize database tables to remote locations, but they also have a set of files that should be synchronized.  As of version 3.5 SymmetricDS now support file synchronization.</p>
      <p>Please see <a href="config.html#file-sync" title="3.5.&nbsp;File Triggers / File Synchronization">Section&nbsp;3.5, &#8220;File Triggers / File Synchronization&#8221;</a>

    <p>There are several industry recognized techniques to capture changing
    data for replication, synchronization and integration in a relational
    database.</p>

    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Lazy data capture</em></span> queries changed data from
        a source system using some SQL condition (like a time stamp
        column).</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Trigger-based data capture</em></span> installs
        database triggers to capture changes.</p>
      </li><li>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>Log-based data capture</em></span> reads data changes
        from proprietary database recovery logs.</p>
      </li></ul></div>

    <p>All three of these techniques have advantages and disadvantages, and
    all three are on the road map for SymmetricDS. At present time,
    SymmetricDS supports trigger-based data capture and partial lazy data
    capture. These two techniques were implemented first for a variety of
    reasons, not the least of which is that the majority of use cases that
    SymmetricDS targets can be solved using trigger-based and conditional
    replication in a way that allows for more database platforms to be
    supported using industry standard technologies. This fact allowed SymmetricDS
    developers' valuable time and energy to be invested in designing a product
    that is easy to install, configure and manage versus spending time reverse
    engineering proprietary and not well documented database log files.</p>

    <p>Trigger-based data capture does introduce a measurable amount of
    overhead on database operations. The amount of overhead can vary greatly
    depending on the processing power and configuration of the database
    platform, and the usage of the database by applications. With nonstop
    advances in hardware and database technology, trigger-based data capture
    has become feasible for use cases that involve high data throughput or
    require scaling out.</p>

    <p>Trigger-based data capture is easier to implement and support than
    log-based solutions. It uses well known database concepts and is very
    accessible to software and database developers and database
    administrators. It can usually be installed, configured, and managed by
    application development teams or database administrators and does not
    require deployment on the database server itself.</p>
